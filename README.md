    cd MemoLock
  *Install the Dependencies*
 

    npm install
 *Run the Development Environment*
 

    npm start
    

# Technologies Used

MemoLock stores your files in a distributed way on IPFS, and stores the Encrypted content ID on Blockchain.

## IPFS

-   InterPlanetary File System peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed manner.
    
-   Distributed and Decentralised File Sharing system
    
-   A file gets divided into pieces and gets distributed whole over internet
    
-   Files gets encrypted and gets uploaded

## Blockchain

-   Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network.
    
-   Distributed Decentralised network helps in easy transfer of file.
    
-   The project is built on ethereum and ensures security through a smart contract.
## Encryption

-   Transport-encryption is used when sending data between two parties.
    
-   We are using AES-256-GCM standard for encrypting the files.
    
-   The key is provided by the user thus making it full secure.
# Working Explanation

1.  Files uploaded to IPFS
    
2.  Encrypted by the key provided
    
3.  Address is granted access in smart contract
    
4.  Receiver enters the token number and file password
    
5.  File is fetched and opened in new tab to view or download.
# Notable Features

-   The file goes under 3 way security system, making it highly secure.
    
-   No signups to get started, just a MetaMask wallet and gas fees.
    
-   You provide a key to encrypt the file thus no one can access the file.
    
-   Want to revoke access to file donâ€™t worry we have got you covered with revoke feature.
    
-   File gets stored in distributed format over multiple number of nodes.
    
-   Files get deleted over time.
